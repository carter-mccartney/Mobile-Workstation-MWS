This is a direct copy the repository that embodied our Senior Design Project, the Mobile Workstation (MWS).
It is not a working project because it requires several hardware components that are now split up between members of our group.
The separate branches display different levels of progression that we made on the project, and the final integrated workspace is found in the "integration" branch.
PLEASE ask me about this project if you have any questions, especailly if you are here because I sent you my resume ;)
